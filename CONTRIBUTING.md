## Code of Conduct

This project follows a standard open-source code of conduct. Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive in all interactions. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Time-Series-Data-Analysis-and-Trend-Discovery-in-Pakistan-Crop-Prices.git
cd Time-Series-Data-Analysis-and-Trend-Discovery-in-Pakistan-Crop-Prices
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flake8 black        # linting tools for development
```

### 4. Download the dataset

Follow the instructions in [`data/README.txt`](data/README.txt) to download the dataset from Kaggle and configure the `DATA_DIR` path in the notebook.

## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue:

- Search [existing issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicates
- Include your Python version (`python --version`) and OS
- If reporting a bug, include the full traceback and the cell number where it occurs
- If reporting incorrect results, attach the relevant CSV from `results/outputs/`

Use the following labels when filing issues:

| Label | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `bug` | Something produces an error or wrong output |
| `data` | Issue related to dataset loading or schema |
| `enhancement` | Suggesting a new feature or model |
| `documentation` | Typo, missing section, or unclear explanation |
| `performance` | Memory usage, runtime, or scalability concern |

---

## Proposing Changes

For non-trivial changes (new models, new phases, structural refactoring):

1. Open an issue first and describe what you intend to change and why
2. Wait for a maintainer to acknowledge and label it before starting work
3. Reference the issue in your PR: `Closes #<issue-number>`

For small fixes (typos, broken paths, pinned versions):
- Open a PR directly — no issue needed

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch off `main`** using a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-prophet-model
git checkout -b fix/requirements-version-conflict
git checkout -b docs/update-phase3-readme
```

2. **Make your changes** following the [coding standards](#coding-standards) below

3. **Run linting before committing:**

```bash
black --check .
flake8 . --max-line-length=100 --exclude=venv,__pycache__
```

4. **Clear notebook outputs before committing:**

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace notebooks/DM_Project_Final_Deliverable.ipynb
```

5. **Push and open a PR** against the `main` branch with:
   - A clear title summarizing the change
   - A short description of what changed and why
   - Reference to the related issue (if applicable)
   - Screenshots or metric comparisons for result-changing contributions

6. **At least one maintainer review** is required before merging

---

## Coding Standards

All `.py` files must pass the following before merging:

| Tool | Rule |
|------|------|
| `black` | Auto-formatter — run `black .` to fix formatting |
| `flake8` | Max line length 100, no unused imports |
| Naming | `snake_case` for functions and variables, `UPPER_CASE` for constants |
| Docstrings | All public functions must have a one-line docstring minimum |
| Type hints | Encouraged for function signatures |

Example of acceptable function style:

```python
def compute_mape(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """Return Mean Absolute Percentage Error between true and predicted values."""
    mask = y_true != 0
    return np.mean(np.abs((y_true[mask] - y_pred[mask]) / y_true[mask])) * 100
```

---

## Notebook Guidelines

- **Cell order matters** — all notebooks must run cleanly top-to-bottom via `Kernel → Restart & Run All`
- **No committed outputs** — clear all cell outputs before pushing (`make clean` handles this)
- **One notebook per phase** is preferred; do not merge unrelated analysis into existing notebooks
- **Magic commands** (`%timeit`, `%matplotlib inline`) are acceptable; shell commands (`!pip install`) inside notebooks are not — add to `requirements.txt` instead
- **Markdown cells** should accompany every major code section explaining what the cell does and why

---

## Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]
[optional footer: Closes #issue]
```

**Types:**

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new model, phase, or analysis |
| `fix` | A bug fix or incorrect result correction |
| `docs` | README, CONTRIBUTING, or docstring changes |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no behaviour change |
| `chore` | Dependency updates, CI config, tooling |
| `perf` | Performance improvement (memory, speed) |

**Examples:**

```
feat(modeling): add Prophet model to Phase 2 forecasting pipeline
fix(phase1): correct Winsorization bounds applied per city instead of globally
docs(readme): add clustering silhouette scores to results table
chore(deps): pin xgboost to 2.0.3 in requirements.txt
```
